# Knapsack Problem

The knapsack problem is an optimization problem in which the aim is to try and fit items in a knapsack such that the value of the items in the knapsack is maximized without going over the weight limit.

## Genetic Algorithm

This program uses a genetic algorithm to try and find a solution given a set of items and a capacity for the knapsack.
